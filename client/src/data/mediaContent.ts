We often think about human-induced climate change as something that will happen in the future, but it is happening now. Ecosystems and people in the United States and around the world are affected by the ongoing process of climate change today.

Climate change affects the environment in many different ways, including rising temperatures, sea level rise, drought, flooding, and more. These events affect things that we depend upon and value, like water, energy, transportation, wildlife, agriculture, ecosystems, and human health.

## Our changing climate

NOAA monitors weather and climate around the world. Here are some of the ways that climate change is affecting our planet. You can explore more at [NOAA's Global Climate Dashboard](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature).

> **Important Note**: Climate data shows that the average global temperature has risen by approximately 1.1°C since the late 1800s, with most warming occurring in the past 40 years.

Here's a simple calculation for temperature conversion:

\`\`\`javascript
// Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
function celsiusToFahrenheit(celsius) {
  return (celsius * 9/5) + 32;
}

// Example: 1.1°C increase = 1.98°F increase
const tempIncrease = celsiusToFahrenheit(1.1) - celsiusToFahrenheit(0);
console.log(\`Temperature increase: \${tempIncrease}°F\`);
\`\`\`

**Key climate indicators** include temperature, precipitation patterns, and *extreme weather events*. Scientists use the \`CO2\` concentration measurement to track greenhouse gas levels.

## A complex issue

Climate change impacts our society in many different ways. Drought can harm food production and human health. Flooding can lead to spread of disease, death, and damage ecosystems and infrastructure. Human health issues that result from drought, flooding, and other weather conditions increase the death rate, change food availability, and limit how much a worker can get done, and ultimately the productivity of our economy.

## Hope for the future

There is still time to lessen the impacts and severity of climate change. We already know many of the problems and solutions, and researchers continue to find new ones. Experts believe we can avoid the worst outcomes by reducing emissions to zero as quickly as possible, which will limit warming.

> "The greatest threat to our planet is the belief that someone else will save it." - **Robert Swan**, Polar Explorer

To meet this goal, we will have to invest in new technology and infrastructure, which will spur job growth. For example, we will need to continue improving technology and facilities that capture and process renewable energy.

Key renewable energy technologies include:
- *Solar photovoltaic panels* with efficiency rates above 20%
- **Wind turbines** generating up to 15MW of power
- Hydroelectric systems using \`run-of-river\` technology

For more information, visit the [International Energy Agency](https://www.iea.org/) website.

Lowering emissions will also benefit human health, saving countless lives and billions of dollars in expenses related to health.

## Diving deeper into climate change impacts

In the following sections, we will look at some of the effects climate change has on our resources and society. Use the links below to jump to a specific section.

## Water

The effects of climate change on our water resources can have a big impact on our world and our lives. Patterns of where, when, and how much precipitation falls are changing as temperatures rise. Some areas are experiencing heavier rain events while others are having more droughts.

> Climate scientists use **precipitation data** to track changes in the water cycle and predict future weather patterns.

Flooding is an increasing issue as our climate is changing. Compared to the beginning of the 20th century, precipitation events are stronger, heavier, and more frequent across most of the United States.

Here's how scientists calculate *rainfall intensity*:

\`\`\`python
# Calculate rainfall intensity (mm/hour)
def rainfall_intensity(total_rainfall_mm, duration_hours):
    return total_rainfall_mm / duration_hours

# Example: 50mm of rain in 2 hours
intensity = rainfall_intensity(50, 2)
print(f"Rainfall intensity: {intensity} mm/hour")
\`\`\`

Drought is also becoming more common, especially in the **Western United States**. We are using more water during hot weather, especially for agriculture. Much like we sweat more when it is hot out, hot weather causes plants to lose, or *transpire*, more water. Then, farmers must give their crops more water.

For real-time drought monitoring, check the [U.S. Drought Monitor](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/) which uses the \`Palmer Drought Severity Index\`.

Snowpack is an important source of fresh water for many people. As the snow melts, fresh water becomes available for use. Snowmelt is particularly important in regions like the Western United States where there is not much precipitation in warmer months. But as temperatures warm, there is less snow and snow begins to melt earlier in the year. This means that snowpack is less likely to be a reliable source of water.

## Food

Our food supply depends on climate and weather conditions. Higher temperatures, drought and water stress, diseases, and weather extremes create challenges for farmers and ranchers. Farmers, ranchers, and researchers can address some of these challenges by adapting their methods or creating and using new technology. But, some changes will be difficult to manage, like human and livestock health. Farmworkers can suffer from heat-related health issues, like exhaustion, heatstroke, and heart attacks. Heat can also harm livestock.

## Human health

Climate change is already impacting human health. Changes in weather and climate patterns put lives at risk in many ways:

- Heat is one of the most deadly weather conditions.
- As ocean temperatures rise, hurricanes are getting stronger and wetter, which can cause death during the hurricane itself and in the aftermath.
- Dry conditions lead to more wildfires, which bring many health risks.
- More flooding leads to the spread of waterborne diseases, injuries, death, and chemical hazards.
- As geographic ranges of mosquitoes, ticks, and other pests expand, they carry diseases to new locations.

## The environment

Climate change affects all living things, or organisms, and the environment they live in, but not equally. The Arctic is one of the ecosystems most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. It is warming at least twice as fast as the global average. Warming in the Arctic has impacts that are felt across the globe — melting land ice sheets and glaciers contribute dramatically to sea level rise. Sea levels are also rising due to thermal expansion. Higher sea level puts coastal areas at greater risk of erosion and storm surge.

Effects of climate change can build upon one another to damage ecosystems. Sea level rise can cause sediment to smother corals. But, coral reefs are also vulnerable to many other effects of climate change: warming waters can lead to coral bleaching and stronger hurricanes can destroy reefs. Coral reef ecosystems are home to thousands of species, which rely on healthy coral reefs to survive.

Some organisms are able to adapt to and even benefit from climate change. Some plants have longer growing seasons or are blooming earlier. But, these changes can happen too fast for other plants and animals to keep up. For example, an earlier blooming plant may depend on a pollinator that does not adapt as quickly.

There are also species that have adapted by expanding or shifting their geographic range, meaning they live in new places that used to be too cold or unsuitable in other ways. As a species expands or shifts its range, it may harm other species that already live in the new area. Existing invasive or nuisance species, like lionfish and ticks, may also thrive in even more places because of climate change.

Ocean ecosystems face an additional challenge: ocean acidification. The ocean absorbs about 30% of the carbon dioxide we release into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels. As a result, the water is becoming more acidic, which affects marine life.`

    transcript: `## Marine Biology: A Journey Through Ocean Life

**[0:00]** Welcome to the fascinating world of marine biology. Today, we'll explore the incredible diversity of life beneath the ocean's surface.

**[0:15]** The ocean covers more than 70% of our planet's surface and contains 99% of the living space on Earth. This vast aquatic realm is home to countless species, from microscopic plankton to massive blue whales.

**[0:35]** Marine ecosystems are incredibly complex networks of interdependent organisms. Each species plays a crucial role in maintaining the delicate balance of ocean life.

**[1:00]** Let's begin our journey in the sunlit surface waters, known as the euphotic zone. Here, photosynthetic organisms like phytoplankton form the base of the marine food web.

**[1:20]** Phytoplankton are microscopic plants that drift in ocean currents. Despite their tiny size, they produce over half of the world's oxygen and absorb massive amounts of carbon dioxide.

**[1:45]** Moving deeper, we encounter the twilight zone, where bioluminescent creatures create their own light. Jellyfish, squid, and deep-sea fish have evolved remarkable adaptations to survive in this dim environment.

**[2:10]** The deep ocean represents the largest habitat on Earth, yet it remains largely unexplored. Creatures here have adapted to extreme pressure, near-freezing temperatures, and complete darkness.

**[2:35]** Coral reefs, often called the rainforests of the sea, support an extraordinary variety of marine life. These diverse ecosystems provide food, shelter, and breeding grounds for countless species.

**[3:00]** Unfortunately, marine ecosystems face unprecedented threats from human activities. Climate change, pollution, overfishing, and habitat destruction are putting enormous pressure on ocean life.

**[3:25]** Rising ocean temperatures are causing coral bleaching events, while plastic pollution affects marine animals from the smallest plankton to the largest mammals.

**[3:50]** However, there's reason for hope. Marine protected areas, sustainable fishing practices, and conservation efforts are helping to preserve these vital ecosystems.

**[4:15]** As we continue to explore and understand marine biology, we discover new species and uncover the secrets of ocean life. Each discovery reminds us of the importance of protecting our blue planet.

**[4:40]** The future of marine biology depends on our commitment to conservation and sustainable practices. By working together, we can ensure that future generations will inherit healthy, thriving oceans.

**[5:00]** Thank you for joining us on this journey through the fascinating world of marine biology. Remember, every action we take can help protect the incredible diversity of life in our oceans.`
